Features
Interactive Input: Prompts the user to input required information (e.g., usernames, PHP versions, domain names).
Custom Configuration: Automatically generates and applies configuration files for Apache, PHP, and other services.
Selective Execution: Allows users to run only the desired parts of the setup.
Reusable: Skips previously completed steps if configurations already exist.
Prerequisites
A Linux server with sudo privileges.
An internet connection for downloading necessary packages and repositories.

./setup_server.sh
Follow the prompts to select and configure the desired services.

Transferring Data (Optional):

Use rsync to transfer user data:
bash

During the script execution, you will be prompted for input such as:

Username: john_doe
Domain Name: example.com
PHP Version: 8.3
MariaDB Version: 10.6
Troubleshooting
If a configuration file already exists, the script skips that step to avoid overwriting.
Make sure to install required dependencies (e.g., curl, unzip, etc.) before running the script.
Check log files (e.g., error.log, access.log) in the user's home directory for debugging.
Notes
Modify the script to suit your specific needs or server environment.
Always test the script in a staging environment before deploying it to production.
Enjoy automating your server setup! ðŸŽ‰
